Smart Battery Project has "Battery Charger for Li-Ion And Li-Po Batteries And Adjustable Power Supply Design" projects ALTIUM DESIGNER project documentation.

TUBITAK Aiming to promote, direct and popularize science and technology in Turkey, They support many of the Project and I have one. 2209-A - Research Project Support Program for Undergraduate Students provide to research diffierent technologies for the students and they support me and my Project ” Smart Battery Charger For Li-Ion and Li-Po Batteries And Adjustable Power Supply” In the Project I designed AC/DC Converter, Buck converter,adjustable battery charger for 0-10A 1S to 4S Li-Ion and Li-Po .I simulate this design parameter PSIM and PSPICE after that I Drawed with ALTIUM DESIGNER.

This Project has; 

4 Layer FR4 1 oZ PCB (without Blind and Buried vias)

Stackup: 1.Top Layer, 2.GND Plane, 3.Power Plane and 4.Bottom Layer

12W AC/DC converter with Flyback topologies(NCP1014AG Flyback Controller)
